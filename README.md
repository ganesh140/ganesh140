I'm an MSc Computer Science student at Julius Maximilians UniversitÃ¤t WÃ¼rzburg, with a solid background in Computer Science & Engineering. I used to be a Multiplatform Front-End Developer at Accenture, where I worked on some pretty cool projects.

Now, I'm all about Machine Learningâ€”figuring out how to make machines smarter and solving real-world problems with code. But hey, I donâ€™t just code for workâ€”I love building my own projects, experimenting with new tech, and sometimes just coding for fun. ðŸš€

Always up for a challenge, always learning. ðŸ˜Ž
